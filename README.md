This is a project for the club that we have been working on in [Dhubaria, Tangail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhubaria_Union).

We started with 5 members and now we are 9. We are looking forward to take this club to great heights and make people appreciate our club.

I used [Next.js]() to create this project, and only used vanilla `CSS` to design it.
